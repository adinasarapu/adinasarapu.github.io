### Dementia
- Dementia is defined as the loss of intellectual functions (such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning) severe enough to interfere with a person’s daily functioning.
- It is not a disease in itself but a group of symptoms that may accompany certain diseases or physical conditions.

### Common types of Dementia
- **Alzheimer’s Disease**: The most common form of dementia, characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline.
- **Parkinson’s Disease Dementia**: Cognitive decline that can occur in later stages of Parkinson's disease, impacting thinking and memory.
- **Huntington’s Disease**: A genetic disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, leading to cognitive decline.

Table summarizing the symptoms, genetics, and markers for Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and Huntington’s Disease:

| **Disease**                | **Symptoms**                                               | **Genetics**                                               | **Markers**                                              |
