This classification highlights the differences between neurodegenerative disorders, which involve progressive degeneration of neurons, and non-neurodegenerative disorders, which may result from various causes and may not lead to progressive neuronal loss.

| **Type**                       | **Movement Disorder**           | **Description**                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Neurodegenerative**          | Parkinson's Disease             | A progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. |
|                                | Huntington's Disease            | A genetic neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain.                    |
| **Non-Neurodegenerative**      | Essential Tremor                | A common movement disorder that causes rhythmic shaking, primarily in the hands but can also affect the head, voice, and other parts of the body. |
|                                | Dystonia                        | A movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures, or twisting movements.                  |
|                                | Tourette Syndrome               | A neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics.                     |
|                                | Ataxia                         | A group of disorders that affect coordination and balance, often resulting from damage to the cerebellum.                     |
|                                | Myoclonus                      | A sudden, brief, and involuntary muscle jerk or spasm.                              |
|                                | Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)    | A condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations.          |
|                                | Cerebral Palsy                 | A group of disorders that affect movement and muscle tone, often caused by brain damage during early development.             |
