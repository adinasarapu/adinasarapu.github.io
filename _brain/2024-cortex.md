The **cerebral cortex** is the outermost layer of the brain, responsible for higher-order brain functions such as perception, cognition, and voluntary movement. It consists of several regions that are divided based on their location and function:

### 1. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Located at the front of the brain, it is involved in:
     - **Motor control**: The primary motor cortex controls voluntary movements.
     - **Planning and decision-making**: The prefrontal cortex handles executive functions like reasoning, problem-solving, and planning.
     - **Speech production**: Broca's area (usually in the left hemisphere) is critical for language production.
     - **Emotions and personality**: Also heavily involved in regulating mood and behavior.

### 2. **Parietal Lobe**
   - Positioned behind the frontal lobe, it is responsible for:
     - **Sensory processing**: The primary somatosensory cortex receives and processes sensory input from the body (touch, pressure, pain, temperature).
     - **Spatial awareness**: Integrates sensory information to create a sense of spatial orientation and navigation.
     - **Body coordination**: Helps in coordinating movements and understanding spatial relationships.

### 3. **Temporal Lobe**
   - Located on the sides of the brain, it plays a crucial role in:
     - **Auditory processing**: The primary auditory cortex processes sounds and language.
     - **Memory**: The hippocampus, located within the temporal lobe, is essential for the formation of long-term memories.
     - **Speech and language comprehension**: Wernickeâ€™s area (typically in the left hemisphere) is involved in understanding spoken and written language.
     - **Emotions**: Works closely with the limbic system to process emotions and social interactions.

### 4. **Occipital Lobe**
   - Found at the back of the brain, it is mainly responsible for:
     - **Vision**: The primary visual cortex processes visual information such as light, color, and motion.

### 5. **Insular Cortex (Insula)**
   - Located deep within the lateral sulcus, between the temporal and frontal lobes, the insula is involved in:
     - **Interoception**: Sensing the internal state of the body (e.g., pain, hunger, thirst).
     - **Emotional and social processing**: Plays a role in empathy and emotional awareness.
     - **Taste**: Involved in gustatory perception.

### 6. **Cingulate Cortex**
   - Part of the limbic system, the cingulate cortex is involved in:
     - **Emotional regulation**: Helps mediate emotional responses and cognitive functions.
     - **Attention and decision-making**: Supports processes like error detection, conflict resolution, and anticipation of rewards or consequences.

### Structural Features:
- **Gyri**: Raised ridges on the surface of the cerebral cortex.
- **Sulci**: Grooves or fissures that separate gyri.
  
### Functional Areas:
The cerebral cortex can also be divided into **primary areas** responsible for direct sensory or motor functions (e.g., primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex) and **association areas** that integrate and process information across different sensory and cognitive domains.

The cerebral cortex is essential for complex tasks such as reasoning, memory, sensory interpretation, and voluntary movement, making it the center of conscious thought and action.
