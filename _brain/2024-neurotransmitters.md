**GABAergic** neurons are a type of **inhibitory** neuron in the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. **Glutamatergic** neurons are a type of neuron that primarily release glutamate, the main **excitatory** neurotransmitter in the brain.  

GABA is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which is the rate-limiting step in this pathway. Neurons can transition from an excitatory to an inhibitory role by adjusting their neurotransmitter synthesis. When glutamate levels increase, some neurons enhance GAD expression, resulting in greater GABA production. This adaptation enables neurons to respond to changing physiological conditions, providing necessary inhibitory signals to balance excitatory activity and maintain homeostasis within neural circuits.

| **Neurotransmitter** | **Releasing Neurons**          | **Receptors**                              | **Specific Parts of CNS**        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Glutamate**         | Glutamatergic neurons         | Ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA, Kainate) and Metabotropic (mGluRs) | Cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum   |
| **GABA**              | GABAergic neurons             | Ionotropic (GABA\(_A\)) and Metabotropic (GABA\(_B\)) | Widespread, especially in cortex and cerebellum |
| **Glycine**           | Glycinergic neurons           | Ionotropic (Glycine receptors)           | Spinal cord, brain stem           |

**Ionotropic** receptors are fast-acting receptors that form ion channels; when activated by a neurotransmitter, they allow ions to flow directly across the membrane, leading to rapid changes in neuronal excitability.  

**Metabotropic** receptors, on the other hand, are slower and act through signaling cascades involving second messengers, modulating cellular functions over a longer duration. This distinction is crucial for understanding how neurotransmitters influence neuronal communication and overall brain function.
