**Neurotransmitters (Non-Catecholamine Types)**

This table summarizes various neurotransmitters that are not classified as catecholamines. It includes their roles (excitatory or inhibitory), the neurons that release them, their specific types (such as amino acids, monoamines, quaternary amines, and neuropeptides), and their primary functions within the nervous system. The neurotransmitters listed play essential roles in regulating mood, cognition, motor control, and physiological responses, contributing to the overall balance of neural activity.

| **Neurotransmitter**  | **Role**                     | **Neurons that Release**  | **Type**        | **Functions**                                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GABA**               | Inhibitory                   | GABAergic neurons          | Amino Acid      | Major inhibitory neurotransmitter, reduces neuronal excitability, regulates muscle tone. |
| **Glutamate**          | Excitatory                   | Glutamatergic neurons      | Amino Acid      | Major excitatory neurotransmitter, involved in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. |
| **Glycine**            | Inhibitory                   | Glycinergic neurons        | Amino Acid      | Inhibitory action in the spinal cord and brainstem, involved in motor control. |
| **Serotonin**          | Can be both (mainly inhibitory) | Serotonergic neurons      | Monoamine       | Regulates mood, appetite, sleep, and circadian rhythms, often linked to depression. |
| **Histamine**          | Excitatory                   | Histaminergic neurons      | Monoamine       | Plays roles in wakefulness, appetite control, and inflammatory responses. |
| **Endorphins**         | Inhibitory                   | Released by various neurons (e.g., interneurons) | Neuropeptide | Involved in pain relief and reward mechanisms, act as natural opioids. |
| **Acetylcholine**      | Excitatory                   | Cholinergic neurons        | Quaternary Amine| Involved in muscle contraction (at neuromuscular junctions), learning, and memory. |
