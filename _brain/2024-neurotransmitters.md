GABAergic neurons are a type of inhibitory neuron in the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, playing a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability and regulating various brain functions.
