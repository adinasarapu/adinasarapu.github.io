GABAergic neurons are a type of inhibitory neuron in the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, playing a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability and regulating various brain functions.  

| **Amino Acid Neurotransmitter** | **Function**                               | **Receptors**                      | **Characteristics**                                         |

| **Glutamate**                    | Primary excitatory neurotransmitter       | NMDA, AMPA, kainate                | Involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory; overactivity can lead to excitotoxicity. |
| **GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)** | Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter        | GABA\(_A\), GABA\(_B\)            | Reduces neuronal excitability; plays a crucial role in anxiety regulation and sleep. |
