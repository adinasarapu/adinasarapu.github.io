Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein, mainly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain. Protein biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are critical for understanding disease mechanisms, early diagnosis, and developing therapeutic strategies. Several key biomarkers have been identified and investigated in PD research:

1. **Alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein)**: The most prominent protein associated with PD. Aggregation of α-synuclein into Lewy bodies is a hallmark of the disease. Detecting abnormal forms of α-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and even saliva is a major focus of biomarker research.

2. **DJ-1 (PARK7)**: DJ-1 is involved in antioxidative stress mechanisms. Lower levels of DJ-1 have been observed in the CSF of PD patients, making it a potential biomarker for early diagnosis.

3. **Tau Protein**: Although primarily linked to Alzheimer's disease, tau has been studied in PD, particularly in cases where Parkinsonism overlaps with dementia. Altered tau levels in CSF may help differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative diseases.

4. **Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)**: This structural protein is released into the CSF and blood during neurodegeneration. Elevated NfL levels are indicative of neuronal damage and may serve as a biomarker for disease progression in PD.

5. **Urate**: Low levels of urate in the blood have been associated with an increased risk of developing PD. It has antioxidant properties, and some studies suggest it could be protective against neurodegeneration.

6. **LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2)**: Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are a common genetic cause of PD, and increased kinase activity has been observed in PD patients. LRRK2 is being studied both as a genetic biomarker and therapeutic target.

7. **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)**: GFAP is a marker of astroglial activation. Elevated levels in biofluids suggest gliosis, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.

Identifying and validating these and other protein biomarkers is ongoing, with many studies focusing on combinations of markers for more accurate diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.

| **Increase in SNCA expression**       | Increase in α-synuclein protein leads to increased aggregation and cell death                                | Increase in SNCA gene dose (duplications or triplications) causes Parkinson’s disease; SNCA common variants probably lead to increased expression | α-Synuclein and phospho-synuclein measurement in blood and CSF        |
| **Increase in α-synuclein aggregation** | Formation of oligomers and fibrils leads to cellular toxicity                                                | Coding mutations in SNCA lead to increase in α-synuclein aggregation                  | rt-QUIC assays for aggregation based on CSF, skin biopsies, olfactory mucosal biopsies, and saliva |

| **Altered endosomal-lysosomal trafficking** | Activation of LRRK2 and VPS35 leads to decreased lysosomal function and altered response to membrane damage | Rare pathogenic variants in LRRK2 (e.g., Gly2019Ser) and VPS35 lead to increased Rab phosphorylation | Measurement of Rab protein phosphorylation in cells from peripheral blood; measurement of urinary BMP phospholipids |
