The embryonic brain develops through the enlargement of neural tube vesicles, first forming three primary vesicles and later five secondary vesicles.

In general, the adult brain can be categorized into four main parts: the **cerebrum**, **brainstem**, **cerebellum**, and **diencephalon**.

- The **cerebrum** develops directly from the **telencephalon**.
- The **cerebellum** forms from the **metencephalon**, along with the **pons**.
- The **brainstem** consists of the **midbrain**, **pons**, and **medulla oblongata**.
- The **diencephalon** gives rise to important structures such as the **thalamus**, **hypothalamus**, and **epithalamus**.

- The **cerebrum** consists of two **cerebral hemispheres** separated by the **longitudinal fissure**.
- The **corpus callosum** forms the floor of the **longitudinal fissure**, separating the two cerebral hemispheres.
- Part of the **corpus callosum** also forms the roof of the **lateral ventricles**.
- The **lateral ventricles** are the two largest ventricles in the brain and contain **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**.  

A sulcus is a depression or groove in the cerebral cortex while a gyrus is a ridge-like elevation found on the surface of the cerebral cortex.

Gray matter (GM) consists of neuronal cell bodies and is responsible for processing information, while white matter (WM) comprises myelinated axons that connect different brain regions. Changes in GM and WM volumes are significant in diagnosing neurological conditions. For instance, WM loss occurs in multiple sclerosis due to axonal damage, and GM volume decreases in neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where motor neurons die, especially in the spinal cord.

The two primary categories of cells in the brain are neurons and glial cells.

A "brain cell" is a broad term that often specifically refers to neurons, while "nuclei" refers to clusters of cell bodies in the CNS, which are organized based on functional similarities.  

These nuclei can be broadly categorized into two types:

**Subcortical nuclei:** Located deep within the brain, beneath the cerebral cortex. Examples include the basal ganglia (involved in motor control), the thalamus (a sensory relay center), and the hypothalamus (which regulates vital functions like hunger and sleep).
  
**Cortical nuclei:** Found in the cerebral cortex, the brainâ€™s outer layer. These include sensory nuclei (which process input from the senses), motor nuclei (which control movement), and association nuclei (which integrate different types of information).

The **Basal Ganglia** is a group of interconnected nuclei in the brain involved in motor control, cognition, and emotion. Here's a breakdown of its major components:

- **Striatum**: 
  - **Caudate nucleus** 
  - **Putamen**
  - **Ventral striatum** (includes the nucleus accumbens, involved in reward processing)
  
- **Globus Pallidus**:
  - **Internal segment (GPi)**
  - **External segment (GPe)**
  - **Ventral pallidum** (involved in reward and motivation)

- **Subthalamic nucleus**: Crucial for regulating movements and motor output.

- **Substantia nigra**:
  - **Pars compacta (SNc)**: Produces dopamine, essential for motor control.
  - **Pars reticulata (SNr)**: Sends inhibitory signals, mainly to the thalamus.

**Afferent projections** refer to nerve fibers that bring signals *to* a specific brain region from other areas. **Efferent projections** refer to nerve fibers that carry signals *away* from a specific brain region to other parts of the brain or body.

   - The striatum receives input (afferent projections) from several regions of the brain. The primary inputs come from:
     - **Cerebral cortex**: This is the cortico-striatal pathway, where sensory and motor information is sent to the striatum for processing.
     - **Thalamus**: Sends modulatory signals to the striatum, influencing motor and cognitive functions.
     - **Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)**: Dopaminergic projections from the SNc play a key role in modulating striatal activity, especially in reward processing and motor control.

   - Once the striatum processes the input signals, it sends outputs (efferent projections) to other brain areas to regulate movement and behavior. The primary efferent projections go to:
     - **Globus pallidus (GP)**: The striatum projects to both the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus, which is a critical part of the motor output pathway.
     - **Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)**: The striatum also sends inhibitory signals to the SNr, which in turn influences motor functions by projecting to the thalamus.
