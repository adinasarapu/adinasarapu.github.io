The embryonic brain develops through the enlargement of neural tube vesicles, first forming three primary vesicles and later five secondary vesicles.

In general, the adult brain can be categorized into four main parts: the **cerebrum**, **brainstem**, **cerebellum**, and **diencephalon**.

- The **cerebrum** develops directly from the **telencephalon**.
- The **cerebellum** forms from the **metencephalon**, along with the **pons**.
- The **brainstem** consists of the **midbrain**, **pons**, and **medulla oblongata**.
- The **diencephalon** gives rise to important structures such as the **thalamus**, **hypothalamus**, and **epithalamus**.

- The **cerebrum** consists of two **cerebral hemispheres** separated by the **longitudinal fissure**.
- The **corpus callosum** forms the floor of the **longitudinal fissure**, separating the two cerebral hemispheres.
- Part of the **corpus callosum** also forms the roof of the **lateral ventricles**.
- The **lateral ventricles** are the two largest ventricles in the brain and contain **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**.
