Rapid development of information technology has promoted World Wide Web (WWW) as a main dissemination hub for many biological data and literature. However, most of the information remains inaccessible to the users due to lack of inter connectivity of the data or databases, or lack of common machine-readable data exchange formats. The recent adaptation of semantic web technology by data providers has enhanced the process of data sharing, mining and integration of biological information across different data resources within the context of web accessibility of data.
