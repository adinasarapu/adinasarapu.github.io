Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are widely used to model human genetic diseases. The most common strategy involves collecting cells from relevant individuals and then reprogramming them into iPSCs. This strategy is very powerful, but finding enough individuals with a specific genetic disease can be challenging, especially since most are rare.
