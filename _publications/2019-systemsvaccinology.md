Generating durable humoral immunity through vaccination depends upon effective interaction of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) with germinal center (GC) B cells. Th1 polarization of Tfhcells is an important process shaping the success of Tfh-GC B cell interactions by influencing co-stimulatory and cytokine-dependent Tfhhelp to B cells. However, the question remains whether adjuvant-dependent modulation of Tfhcells enhances HIV-1 vaccine-induced anti-Envelope (Env) antibody responses. We investigated whether an HIV-1 vaccine platform designed to increase the number of Th1-polarized Tfhcells enhances the magnitude and quality of anti-Env antibodies.
