Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause debilitating twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is implicated in many forms of dystonia, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, to reveal abnormal striatal cellular processes and pathways implicated in dystonia, we used an unbiased proteomic approach in a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia, a model in which the striatum is known to play a central role in the expression of dystonia. Fifty-seven of the 1805 proteins identified were differentially regulated in DOPA-responsive dystonia mice compared to control mice. Most differentially regulated proteins were associated with gene ontology terms that implicated either mitochondrial or synaptic dysfunction whereby proteins associated with mitochondrial function were generally over-represented whereas proteins associated with synaptic function were largely under-represented. Remarkably, nearly 20% of the differentially regulated proteins identified in our screen are associated with pathogenic variants that cause inherited dystonic disorders in humans suggesting shared mechanisms across many different forms of dystonia.
