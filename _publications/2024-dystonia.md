Screens for anti-neuronal antibodies did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. Plasma proteomics pointed towards certain abnormalities of immune mechanisms, and the multiplex assay pointed more specifically towards abnormalities in T lymphocytes. Abnormal immune cell frequencies were identified for some Cervical Dystonia (CD) cases, and these cases clustered together as a potential subgroup. Studies of HLA alleles indicated a possible association between CD and DRB1*15:03, which is reported to mediate the penetrance of autoimmune disorders.
