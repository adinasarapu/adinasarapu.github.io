This study was an exploratory, phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 15 participants who were assigned to receive a placebo or dipraglurant (50 or 100 mg) and assessed over 2 days, 1 and 2 hours following dosing. Outcome measures included multiple scales rated by clinicians or participants, digital video, and a wearable sensor.
