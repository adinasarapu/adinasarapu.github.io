Immunosurveillance of the central nervous system (CNS) is vital to resolve infection and injury. However, immune activation within the CNS in the setting of chronic viral infections, such as HIV-1, is strongly linked to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Establishment of HIV-1 in the CNS early following infection underscores the need to delineate features of acute CNS immune activation as these early in ammatory events may mediate neurodegenerative processes.
