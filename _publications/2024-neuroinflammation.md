CD4 T cells survey and maintain immune homeostasis in the brain, yet their differentiation states and functional capabilities remain unclear. Our approach, combining single-cell transcriptomic analysis, ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and flow cytometry, revealed a distinct subset of CCR7+ CD4 T cells resembling lymph node central memory (TCM) cells.
