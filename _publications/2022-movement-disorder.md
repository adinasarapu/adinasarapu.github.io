Numerous studies have linked Parkinson's disease (PD) with low levels of uric acid (UA). Low UA has been associated with the risk of developing PD, and its progression and severity. The biological mechanisms underlying these relationships have never been firmly established. The most frequently proposed mechanism is that UA is an antioxidant. Low UA is thought to predispose to oxidative stress, which contributes to dopamine neuron degeneration, and leads to initial appearance of symptoms of PD and its worsening over time. Several recent studies have questioned this explanation.
