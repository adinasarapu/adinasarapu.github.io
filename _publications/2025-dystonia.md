Abnormal dopamine neurotransmission and striatal dysfunction is implicated in many forms of dystonia, yet the underlying molecular processes remain unknown. Here, we identified thousands of dysregulated genes within striatal spiny projection neuron (SPN) subtypes in a genetic mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission.
