The dorsal striatum is organized into functional territories defined by corticostriatal inputs onto both direct and indirect spiny projection neurons (SPNs), the major cell types within the striatum. In addition to circuit connectivity, striatal domains are likely defined by the spatially determined transcriptomes of SPNs themselves.
