The acquisition of invasive properties is a prerequisite for tumor progression and metastasis. Molecular subtypes of KRAS-driven lung cancer exhibit distinct modes of invasion that likely contribute to unique growth properties and therapeutic susceptibilities. Despite this, pre-clinical discovery strategies designed to exploit invasive phenotypes are lacking. To address this, we designed an experimental system to screen for targetable signaling pathways linked to active early invasion phenotypes in the two most prominent molecular subtypes, TP53 and LKB1, of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). By combining live-cell imaging of human bronchial epithelial cells in a 3D invasion matrix with RNA transcriptome profiling, we identified the LKB1-specific upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6).
