Welcome to my research page!  

My research lies at the crossroads of genomics and computational biology, focusing on variant analysis, copy number variations, gene expression, microbiome profiling, and proteomics. Currently, I am dedicated to identifying genomic signatures and protein targets that could advance drug discovery for movement disorders such as Dystonia and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. Additionally, I am actively involved in disease modeling using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to study Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia as part of the Hess-Jinnah Research Group.

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).
