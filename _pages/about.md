My research is at the intersection of genomics and computing, with a core emphasis on variant and copy number analysis, gene expression, microbiome, and proteomics studies. My current endeavors revolve around identifying genomic signatures and protein targets for drug discovery in movement disorders, particularly Dystonia and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. My involvement extends to other significant initiatives, including disease modeling using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia within the Hess-Jinnah Research Group.

Beyond my primary focus, I am deeply interested in the application of Big Data analytics in medicine and healthcare. My expertise extends to real-time data processing, messaging, and streaming techniques.

Feel free to explore more about my ongoing projects and interests on my website. Your questions and comments are most welcome, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunity for engaging discussions and potential collaborations. Looking forward to hearing from you!

I have migrated most of my content to my new website: [https://sys4seq.com](https://sys4seq.com).  

Previously, at Emory Vaccine Center, I worked in [Human Immunology Project Consortium](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) projects with emphasis in understanding the effects of adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccination in healthy as well as in HIV-infected individuals. At University of Florida, I applied systems biology approaches to study the effects of recreational marijuana and/or tobacco use in HIV-infected young adults. At University of California San Diego, I worked for [LIPID MAPS](http://www.lipidmaps.org) and UCSD [Signaling Gateway consortium](http://www.signalinggateway.org/molecule/) projects.

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).

* _Rectal microbiome composition correlates with humoral immunity to HIV-1 in vaccinated rhesus macaques_  
We assessed the longitudinal changes in vaginal and rectal microbiome profiles following intradermal immunization with an HIV-1 DNA vaccine in adult rhesus macaques that received two prior DNA primes. The rectal and vaginal (CVL) microbiota showed compositional differences at lower taxonomic levels. As demonstrated by the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) plot, microbiome in vaginal and rectal compartments demonstrated characteristic phylotype abundances.
