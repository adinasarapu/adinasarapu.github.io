My research is focused on genomics and computing, with emphasis on variant and copy number analysis, gene expression, microbiome and proteomics studies. Ongoing projects include identification of genomic signatures and, protein targets for drug discovery in movement disorders like Dystonia and Parkinson's Disease. Other projects in this area include disease modeling using Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia (<a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/pharmacology-chemical-biology/labs/hess-jinnah-lab/index.html" target="_blank">Hess-Jinnah Research Group</a>). I am also interested in Big data analytics in medicine and healthcare with real-time data processing, messaging and streaming techniques.  

Please browse through my website and feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments! I look forward to hearing from you!

I have migrated most of my content to my new website: [https://sys4seq.com](https://sys4seq.com).  

Previously, at Emory Vaccine Center, I worked in [Human Immunology Project Consortium](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) projects with emphasis in understanding the effects of adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccination in healthy as well as in HIV-infected individuals. At University of Florida, I applied systems biology approaches to study the effects of recreational marijuana and/or tobacco use in HIV-infected young adults. At University of California San Diego, I worked for [LIPID MAPS](http://www.lipidmaps.org) and UCSD [Signaling Gateway consortium](http://www.signalinggateway.org/molecule/) projects.

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).

* _Rectal microbiome composition correlates with humoral immunity to HIV-1 in vaccinated rhesus macaques_  
We assessed the longitudinal changes in vaginal and rectal microbiome profiles following intradermal immunization with an HIV-1 DNA vaccine in adult rhesus macaques that received two prior DNA primes. The rectal and vaginal (CVL) microbiota showed compositional differences at lower taxonomic levels. As demonstrated by the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) plot, microbiome in vaginal and rectal compartments demonstrated characteristic phylotype abundances.
