My research is focused on genomics and computing, with emphasis on variant and copy number analysis, gene expression and proteomics studies. Particularly, I explore the contribution of population-specific low-frequency and rare variants to human traits. 

I split my time between the Department of Human Genetics, **Emory University** and the **National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases** (NIAID).

Previously, at Emory Vaccine Center, I worked in [Human Immunology Project Consortium](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) projects with emphasis in understanding the effects of adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccination in healthy as well as in HIV-infected individuals. At University of Florida, I applied systems biology approaches to study the effects of recreational marijuana and/or tobacco use in HIV-infected young adults. At University of California San Diego, I worked for [LIPID MAPS](http://www.lipidmaps.org) and UCSD [Signaling Gateway consortium](http://www.signalinggateway.org/molecule/) projects.
