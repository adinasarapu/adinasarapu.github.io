Past Projects
======
Previously, at <strong>Emory Vaccine Center</strong>, I worked in [Human Immunology Project Consortium](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) projects with emphasis in understanding the effects of adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccination in healthy as well as in HIV-infected individuals. At <strong>University of California San Diego</strong>, I worked for [LIPID MAPS](http://www.lipidmaps.org)  and UCSD [Signaling Gateway consortium](http://www.signalinggateway.org/molecule/) projects. At <strong>University of Florida</strong>, I applied systems biology approaches to study the effects of recreational marijuana and/or tobacco use in HIV-infected young adults.
