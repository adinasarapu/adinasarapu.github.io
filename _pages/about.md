I am currently a Bioinformatics Scientist with Mike Zwick ([Department of Human Genetics](https://genetics.emory.edu)) at Emory University.

Since 2018, I split my time between Human Genetics (50%) of Emory University and the NIAID (50%) of [National Institutes of Health](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/).

My research is focused on genomics and computing, with emphasis on rare disease genotyping and gene expression studies using NGS (Whole Genome, Exome and RNASeq) data.
Particularly, I explore the contribution of population-specific low-frequency and rare variants to human traits.

Previously, at _Emory Vaccine Center_, I worked in [Human Immunology Project Consortium](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) projects with emphasis in understanding the effects of adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccination in healthy as well as in HIV-infected individuals. At _University of Florida_, I applied systems biology approaches to study the effects of recreational marijuana and/or tobacco use in HIV-infected young adults. At _University of California San Diego_, I worked for [LIPID MAPS](http://www.lipidmaps.org) and UCSD [Signaling Gateway consortium](http://www.signalinggateway.org/molecule/) projects.
