Welcome to my research page!  

At the intersection of genomics and computational biology, my work dives deep into variant analysis, copy number variation, gene expression, microbiome profiling, and proteomics. I am on a mission to uncover genomic patterns and protein targets that could pave the way for new drug therapies in movement disorders like Dystonia and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. My current focus also includes disease modeling using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to explore the underlying mechanisms of Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia, in collaboration with the Hess-Jinnah Research Group.

Passionate about research, teaching, and securing grants, I am eager to contribute to an academic environment. Always open to collaborations and meaningful conversations ([CV](/cv/) available).

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).
