Welcome to my research page!  

At the intersection of genomics and computational biology, my work dives deep into variant analysis, copy number variation, gene expression, microbiome profiling, and proteomics. I am on a mission to uncover genomic patterns and protein targets that could pave the way for new drug therapies in movement disorders like Dystonia and Parkinson’s disease. My current focus also includes disease modeling using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to explore the underlying mechanisms of Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia, in collaboration with the Hess-Jinnah Research Group.

Passionate about research, teaching, and securing grants, I am eager to contribute to an academic environment. Always open to collaborations and meaningful conversations ([CV](/cv/) available).

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).
