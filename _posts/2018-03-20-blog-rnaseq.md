A simple RNA-Seq differential expression analysis using High Performance Computing (HPC).

The goal is to analyze RNA-Seq data using HPC. The software which will be used in this session is listed below.

1. [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
2. STAR
3. HTSeq
4. EdgeR

This pipeline is available as [RNA-Seq Exercise](https://bitbucket.org/adinasarapu/ibs_class/src)
