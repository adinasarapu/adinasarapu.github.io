Protein quantification by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) uses integrated peak intensity from the parent-ion mass (MS1) or features from fragment-ions (MS2). MS1 methods use the iBAQ algorithm (a protein's total intensity is divided by the number of tryptic peptides), which provides a metric that is expected to be proportional to mass (intensity) to molar amount (iBAQ).Label-free quantitation (LFQ) of proteins aims to determine the relative amount of proteins in two or more biological samples.

Mass spectrometer generated `raw` files are used for label-free quantitation of proteins. Base peak chromatograms are inspected visually using `RawMeat` software. All raw files are processed together in a single run by `MaxQuant` (version 1.6.0.16) with default parameters. Database searches are performed using the `Andromeda` search engine (a peptide search engine based on probabilistic scoring) with the UniProt-SwissProt human canonical database as a reference and a contaminants database of common laboratory contaminants. MaxQuant reports summed intensity for each protein, as well as its iBAQ value. Proteins that share all identified peptides are combined into a single protein group. Peptides that match multiple protein groups (“razor” peptides) are assigned to the protein group with the most unique peptides. MaxQuant employs the MaxLFQ algorithm for label-free quantitation (LFQ). Quantification will be performed using razor and unique peptides, including those modified by acetylation (protein N-terminal), oxidation (Met) and deamidation (NQ). 

Data processing is performed using `Perseus` (version 1.5.0.31). In brief, Protein group LFQ intensities are log2 transformed to reduce the effect of outliers. To overcome the obstacle of missing LFQ values, missing values are imputed before fit the models. Hierarchical clustering is performed on Z-score normalized, log2-transformed LFQ intensities. Log ratios are calculated as the difference in average log2 LFQ intensity values between experimental and control groups. Two-tailed, Student's t test calculations are used in statistical tests if the histograms of LFQ intensities of all data sets approximated as normal distributions. A protein is considered statistically significant if its fold change is ≥ 2 and FDR ≤ 0.01. All the identified differentially expressed proteins are used in protein network or pathway analysis.
