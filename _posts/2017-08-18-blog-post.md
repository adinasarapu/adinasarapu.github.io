CNVs represent gain or loss of genomic regions. CNVs transmit from parents to offspring or arise <i>de novo</i> and play important role in neuro-psychiatric disorders and cancers. Traditionally CNVs are identified through array based approaches but recent advances in genomic technologies, whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches are becaming popular. Existing NGS-based approaches, which detect CNVs for individual sample level, usually yield low-detection accuracy, while joint modeling approaches use maximum advantage of Mendelian transmission within the parent-offspring trio improved CNV detection accuracy.
